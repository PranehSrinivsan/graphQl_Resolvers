Resolver is a function that resolves a value for a type or field in a schema
Resolvers can return objects / scalars
Execution continues to the next child field if an Object is returned
Execution completes if a scalar is returned at a leaf node.

Resolver functions can optionally accept four positional arguments
fieldName: (parent, args, context, info) => data;
parent:
This is the return value of the resolver for this field's parent 
Resolver for a parent field always executes before the resolvers for that field's children
args:
This object contains all GraphQL arguments provided for this field.
context:
This object is shared across all resolvers that execute for a particular operation.
Used to share pre-operation state, such as authentication information and access to data sources
info:
This contains information about the execution state of the operation.
